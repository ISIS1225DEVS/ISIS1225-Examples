This repository contains code examples of the different ADTs in the DISCLib library for the course Data Structures (#EDA) and Algorithms at Universidad de los Andes in Bogotá D.C. Colombia. This code is part of the academic resources of the course and its intent is to give the students ideas and notions about how to use the library in their laboratories and projects.

This repository is part of the data structure and algorithms (#EDA) teaching framework at Universidad de los Andes. The repository was developed by faculty professors and staff in the Department of Systems and Computer Engineer (#DISC) and uses the Non-Object-Oriented Python library **DISCLib**.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This repository is the Cookbook for the data structures and algorithms (#EDA) course at uniandes, it contains examples and code samples for the use of the different ADTs in the DISCLib library.

**IMPORTANT** This is a work in progress and is part of a teaching framework for undergraduate college students at Universidad de los Andes. This project Is NOT intended as a full-functional source code project.

**:construction: :construction: :construction: :construction: :construction: THIS PROJECT IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION!!! :construction: :construction: :construction: :construction: :construction:**

**Beware of the :construction: emoji as it marks the sections still under construction in the repository.**

1. [Examples](./Examples) Folder with the Python scripts. In here the students can check code examples for the different ADTs in the DISCLib API.
    1. [M1](./Examples/M1) Folder with the Python scripts for the first module of the course consisting of examples for the ADT List with Array List, Linked List, Queue, Stack, and the sorting algorithms.
        1. [Read CSV File](./Examples/M1/01-\--csv_fread.py) Python script with an example of how to read a CSV file and store the data in a list.
        1. [List use](./Examples/M1/02-\--list.py) Python script with an example of how to use the List ADT (array and single linked).
        1. [Sortings](./Examples/M1/03-\--sortings.py) Python script with an example of how to use the sorting algorithms in the DISCLib library.
        1. [Queue use](./Examples/M1/04-\--queue.py) Python script with an example of how to use the ADT Queue with ADT List.

<!-- DATA SOURCES -->
### :construction: Data sources :construction:
We use the following datasets in the examples of this repository:

1. The first and second modules use the [Pokemon][pokemon-data-url] from [Kaggle][kaggle-url]. A data's copy is in the [Data/Samples](./Data/Samples) folder.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage
